## 🚀 My Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on during my MSc program:

### 1. Predictive Modelling for Cancer Prognosis
- Developed and evaluated machine learning models to predict cancer patient mortality status ('Alive' vs. 'Dead') and survival duration using the CRISP-DM framework.
- Performed comprehensive data cleaning, feature selection, and exploratory data analysis to prepare the dataset for modelling.
- **Key Technologies:** Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, KNN.

### 2. Web & Social Media Analytics of a Reddit Community
- Conducted a full textual analysis of the `r/LoganPaul` subreddit by scraping approximately 850 comments using the Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW).
- Applied a rigorous NLP pipeline for text preprocessing and used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) for topic modelling and VADER for sentiment analysis to uncover key discussion themes and community sentiment.
- **Key Technologies:** Python, PRAW, Pandas, NLTK, spaCy, VADER, Scikit-learn.

### 3. Business Decision Analysis & Forecasting
- Utilized the Palisade DecisionTools Suite and Excel to solve a series of complex business problems, including loan decision analysis, time-series forecasting, and optimisation.
- Constructed a decision tree with PrecisionTree to determine optimal loan strategy, used StatTools to forecast CO₂ trends, and formulated a linear programming model in Excel Solver to maximize revenue for a housing regeneration project.
- **Key Technologies:** Excel, Palisade Decision Tools (@Risk, PrecisionTree, StatTools), Linear Programming, Time-Series Analysis.

### 4. Data Visualisation of UK Road Accident Severity
- Investigated the relationship between environmental conditions (weather, time of day) and the severity of road accidents in the UK using a large-scale dataset from the Department for Transport.
- Created a series of insightful visualisations including bar charts, pie charts, violin plots, and geographic scatter plots to communicate findings effectively.
- **Key Technologies:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Data Visualisation.
